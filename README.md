# HTTP-Web-Server
`HTTP Protocol` Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents. It was designed for communication between web browser and web server.

`HTTP Web Server` whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware)web server, the (software) HTTP server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested document, it returns a 404 response instead.)

A web client, for example, a web browser, sends an HTTP request to a web server via a network. The web server which is powered by an HTTP server:
* receives this request and processes it
* determines the appropriate response after doing certain checks
* sends this response to the web client.

The response sent by the HTTP server may also include data from files (for example, HTML documents) stored on the webserver.
